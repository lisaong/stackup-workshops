# Text Processing 101 using the spaCy library

## Introduction

Text data is one of the most common forms of “unstructured” data. Unstructured data does not fit neatly into traditional databases, because they can be any length. For example, this paragraph you are reading contains more words than the title. How do you start parsing and processing this type of data, beyond doing traditional string-based searching, regular expressions, or word-for-word matching?

SpaCy is a popular Python natural language processing library that gets you started with text processing very quickly. It is both flexible and powerful, and comes packaged with word vectors, named-entity recognition, and other features.

In this example, you see how to take any blob of text data, tokenise it, and extract information such as keywords using spaCy on Google Colaboratory. You also get some time to play around with spaCy and try your own text data.
